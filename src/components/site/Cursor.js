/**
 * The custom cursor (plan 5.3): a 10 px dot that tracks the pointer exactly and
 * a 28 px ring that lags behind it, with a contextual label over anything that
 * declares one.
 *
 * Three things keep it from costing what custom cursors usually cost.
 *
 * The pointer position never becomes React state. It is written to motion
 * values and read by the compositor, so moving the mouse re-renders nothing —
 * a setState per mousemove is the classic way these wreck INP (rule 7). Only
 * the LABEL is state, and that changes when you enter or leave a target.
 *
 * It is not rendered at all unless the device has a fine pointer, read through
 * `useSyncExternalStore` rather than a mount effect: this repo lints
 * `set-state-in-effect` as an error, and the usual `useEffect(() =>
 * setMounted(true))` would add one. The server snapshot is `false`, so nothing
 * ships to a phone and nothing flashes during hydration.
 *
 * `mix-blend-mode: difference` means it stays visible over the hero photo, the
 * red CTA and both themes without a single colour of its own — which is also
 * why it needs no dark-mode variant (rule 3).
 *
 * To give an element a label, put `data-cursor="voir"` on it; the label text
 * comes from the messages, so it is translated in all four languages. Both the
 * uppercasing and the tracking are `ltr:`-only: Arabic letters join, and
 * letter-spacing pulls those joins apart (rule 3).

          RTL page anchoring to `start` (the right edge) would send the cursor
          the wrong way across the screen. The inner shape needs `left-0` for a
          second reason: an absolutely positioned box with `left: auto` falls
          back to its static position, which in RTL is its container's RIGHT
          edge — so the label sat a full width to the left of the pointer in
          Arabic while being pixel-perfect in French. This is the rare case
          where physical properties are the correct ones. Each layer is a bare point and
          the visible shape centres itself inside it, so growing into a pill
          stays centred on the pointer. */}
