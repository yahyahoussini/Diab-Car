/**
 * GET|POST /api/cron/expire-reservations — the two housekeeping sweeps
 * (plan 7.1, supabase/migrations/0012).
 *
 * Diab Car takes no payment online, so `pending` means "a human still has to
 * say yes". A request nobody answered holds a car hostage:
 * `expire_unconfirmed_reservations()` cancels it after
 * `settings.auto_expire_hours` with the reason « non confirmée » — cancelled,
 * never deleted, so the customer's file still shows what happened — and the
 * car goes back on sale.
 *
 * `refresh_cleaning_blocks()` is the other half. A returned car is blocked for
 * `settings.cleaning_minutes`; if nobody presses « Marquer prête » before that
 * window closes, the car would quietly become bookable while it is still
 * dirty. This sweep extends the block for as long as the unit says
 * `cleaning`, so forgetting the button costs an hour of availability rather
 * than a customer standing next to an unwashed car.
 *
 * 0012 schedules both on pg_cron (hourly and every ten minutes) when the
 * extension is available; this route is the other half of that promise for a
 * project where it is not — point a Cloudflare Cron Trigger at it and the
 * sweeps happen either way. Running both is harmless: expiring an expired
 * request is a no-op, and the block refresh only writes for units that have no
 * live cleaning block.
 *
 * Protected by CRON_SECRET. `/api/*` is excluded from the proxy matcher, so no
 * middleware runs here and the route must guard itself.
