# Diab Car — build status

**Updated:** 2026-09-08 · **Branch:** `build/v1` · **Last prompt:** PROMPT 12 — admin fleet, operations, content, settings (Sprint 4c). The closed loop retour → nettoyage → prête → disponibilité publique works end to end and is tested. **Web Push transport still NOT done (PROMPT 10 carry-over). Hosting: Vercel Pro (owner, PROMPT 17).**

This file is the running state of the build. It is rewritten at the end of **every** prompt in `docs/PROMPTS.md`.
Decisions in the *Plan §10* column come from `docs/MASTER-PLAN.md` §10 (keep / rebuild / extend / delete); where §10 is
silent the decision is derived from the section named in *Why*, and every such call is listed under
[Decisions §10 does not settle](#decisions-10-does-not-settle) so no later prompt has to re-litigate it.

**Status column** — `done` = nothing outstanding for this file under the plan (every **keep** row, plus what this
prompt finished). `todo` = a **rebuild / extend / delete** still to execute. Note that **keep** rows still inherit the
Sprint 0 token change and are re-verified in the Sprint 6 accessibility/RTL pass — "keep" means *no rewrite planned*,
not *never touched again*.

## Baseline checks — re-measured at PROMPT 03

| Command | Result | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `npm run build` | **pass** | 139 static pages, Next 16.3.4 + Turbopack, 1 warning (see below) |
| `npm run lint` | **10 errors, 1 warning** | all pre-existing in BookingForm/BookingWidget/CookieBanner/CurrencyProvider/Header/LanguageSwitcher/ThemeToggle (React Compiler rules) — see issue 14. The 9 new sections lint clean |
| `npm test` | **pass** — 41/41 | `src/lib/{pricing,whatsapp,format}.test.js` |
| `npm run test:e2e` | **pass** — 12/12 | 4 locales + admin + booking by keyboard (fr/ar) + all 9 homepage sections in 4 locales + the purpose-tile filter |
| `npm run check:messages` | **pass** | 640 leaf keys, identical across fr/en/ar/es |
| `npm run check:contrast` | **pass** | 56 pairs, 56 pass, 0 fail; every token of plan §2.2 declared |
| `npm run lh` — /fr | Perf **69–82** · A11y **97** · BP **100** · SEO **100** | LCP 3.42 s · TBT 1004 ms · CLS 0.005 — see issue 15. Readings swing ±40 % on this machine; Speed Index improved 2.57 → 1.11 s at best |
| `npm run lh` — /fr/location-voiture-casablanca | Perf **64** · A11y **95** · BP **100** · SEO **100** | not re-tuned; the fleet page is rebuilt in PROMPT 07 |

Budget (CLAUDE.md rule 7: LCP ≤ 2.0 s, INP ≤ 200 ms via TBT, CLS ≤ 0.05) — **CLS passes; LCP and TBT
still fail.** PROMPT 03 moved Performance 65 → 74 and TBT 3121 → 882 ms (−72 %) by removing a
`filter: blur()` from the LCP element, hinting its preload, dropping three below-the-fold image
preloads and warming the ISR cache before measuring. What remains is CPU, not bytes: every request
completes by ~284 ms while bootup-time is ~3.5 s under Lighthouse's 4× CPU throttle. Closing the gap
means shipping less homepage JavaScript, which is PROMPT 04 (HomeSections rebuild) and Sprint 6
("performance budget CI").

## Open issues carried into Sprint 0

| # | Where | Issue | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `src/styles/globals.css` | ~~light `--success` on `--surface-2` = 4.45:1, plus two `--text-muted` near-misses~~ | **closed at PROMPT 01** — BLACKLINE palette, check:contrast 56/56 |
| 2 | build + dev + start | `⚠ Next.js ignored package-lock.json in C:\Users\yahya because it is outside the current Git repository` — Turbopack infers a workspace root above the repo | one line in `next.config.mjs` (`turbopack.root`/`outputFileTracingRoot`); left alone this prompt (not build-breaking) |
| 3 | `CLAUDE.md` | `next dev` appends a `<!-- BEGIN:nextjs-agent-rules -->` block to CLAUDE.md on every run | stripped at PROMPT 00; permanent fix is `agentRules: false` in `next.config.mjs` — needs Yahya's call |
| 4 | `src/lib/whatsapp.js` | `vehicleInquiryMessage(locale)` with no rental argument renders "…je souhaite reserver la **undefined**" — the `= {}` default only fires on `undefined` | fix when WhatsApp templates are rebuilt (Sprint 3) |
| 5 | `src/lib/pricing.js` | `perDayEffective` is `round(total / days)`, an **average**: 363 × 7 = 2541 ≠ total 2540. CLAUDE.md rule 4 says nothing may appear that was not shown earlier | label it as an average in the UI, or derive it differently (Sprint 3) |
| 6 | `scripts/check-contrast.mjs` | the `--*-soft` tints (`bg-accent-soft text-accent`, `bg-success-soft text-success`, …) are shipped as text backgrounds but are not in the pair list | add a composited soft-tint section once the BLACKLINE palette lands |
| 7 | lint | 6 errors: `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` in `CookieBanner.js:17`, `CurrencyProvider.js:14`, `Header.js:40`, `ThemeToggle.js:12`; `react-hooks/immutability` in `LanguageSwitcher.js:40`; `react-hooks/preserve-manual-memoization` in `BookingForm.js:61`. 3 warnings: unused eslint-disable in `JsonLd.js:10`, `no-img-element` + `alt-text` in `og.js:78` | not fixed at PROMPT 00 ("fix only build-breaking issues"); CLAUDE.md's definition of done requires lint to pass, so these must clear in Sprint 0 |
| 8 | routing | FR slug `/location-voiture-longue-duree-casablanca` in `src/i18n/routing.js` vs the route folder `/longue-duree` — confirm the public URL against plan §3 | PROMPT 13 |
| 9 | `src/app/favicon.ico` | ~~gold-era binary~~ **closed** — regenerated from the real mark as a 16/32/48 PNG-in-ICO (Next lists favicon.ico first, so this one mattered) | — |
| 10 | brand assets | ~~placeholder shield~~ **closed** — the real mark arrived (`public/brand/badge*.png`, Sept 2026). Wired: header emblem + Archivo wordmark, footer full lockup (light/dark cuts), OG card, `icon.svg`, `icon.png`, `apple-icon.png`, manifest icons incl. maskable, and a regenerated `favicon.ico` (16/32/48). Raster only — no vector was supplied, so `Logo.js` documents the swap-to-SVG path | plan §12 input #1 closed; placeholders `badge-temp*.svg` deleted; the four 1254² masters moved to `docs/inputs/logo/` (the plan's intake folder), only derived files stay in `public/brand/` |
| 20 | brand colour vs tokens | ~~#c80018 vs #b71920~~ **decided (owner, via logic): the token follows the logo.** `--red` is now `#c80018` (light hover `#a80014`, dark hover `#dc0a22`, red-soft/glow retinted); `--red-signal` dark stays `#f0383f`; `--text` stays `#0a0a0a`. Gate: 6.05:1 on white, 5.12 on --surface-2, white-on-red 6.05 | closed — plan §2.2 updated |
| 11 | `--text-muted`, `--success`, `--warning` | deviate from the hexes printed in plan §2.2 (see the token comments for the measured ratios). §2.2's values fail AA on `--surface-1`/`--surface-2` | plan §2.2 needs a one-line amendment, or the deviation is accepted as-is |
| 12 | `--accent*` compatibility aliases in `globals.css` | 37 files still reference the previous palette's token names; they now resolve onto BLACKLINE so nothing breaks | delete each alias as its last caller is rebuilt (prompts 02–13) |
| 13 | Arabic OG cards | satori spaces Arabic words oddly in RTL (visible gap between title words) | cosmetic; revisit when §9.3 moves OG generation to build time |
| 14 | `BookingWidget.js`, `Header.js` | 5 new React Compiler lint errors: `set-state-in-effect` (localStorage-after-mount, media-query sync, time-chip snap-back) and `refs` (a handler that focuses an input). Each is an idiomatic pattern the compiler cannot prove safe | fix with `useSyncExternalStore` in PROMPT 02's kit pass; 3 of the 8 the agents introduced are already fixed with derive-during-render |
| 15 | homepage JS | LCP 2.91 s / TBT 882 ms vs a 2.0 s / 200 ms budget. All bytes land by 284 ms; bootup-time is ~3.5 s — it is JS execution, not transfer | PROMPT 04 (lighter HomeSections) then Sprint 6 performance CI |
| 23 | homepage photography | **8 of 8 supplied and live** — hero, 6 fleet cars and now the airport scene (`scene-airport`, 1672×941, four widths). 20 cars still show category silhouettes | generate the rest from the shot list, or shoot the real fleet (plan §2.5) |
| 24 | PROMPT 05 defects found on re-audit | Four, all of which would have fired on first apply: (a) 0002/0003 only `alter` tables that `supabase/schema.sql` creates, and no run order said so — a fresh project died on `relation "settings" does not exist`; (b) 0005 dropped the starter's `public read reviews` and never recreated one, so anon would have seen **zero** reviews in production while demo mode looked fine; (c) `public_settings` was `security_invoker = true`, which makes the view obey the very RLS it exists to bypass — anon would have got 0 rows and the site would have lost its phone number, hours and trust facts; (d) the adapter read the `settings` **table**, now staff-only, instead of that view | **all four fixed**; run order documented + guarded in 0001, `reviews public read` recreated (and it now excludes `is_sample` at the database, not just in the component), view is definer, adapter split into `getSettings()` / `getSettingsAdmin()`, regression test in `src/lib/data/adapters.test.js` |
| 25 | `0007_verify.sql` used `set local role anon` | `set local` is only honoured inside an explicit transaction block. In a SQL editor that does not give you one it warns and does nothing — the RLS proof would have run as `postgres`, returned non-zero units/customers, and read as "RLS is broken" when the test simply never ran | fixed: plain `set role anon` … `reset role`, plus new assertions for reviews, sample reviews and `index_now_key` non-exposure |
| 16 | ~~`docs/inputs/photos/` empty~~ | partially resolved: `npm run images` is built and self-tested but has nothing to process, so every car is a silhouette and the card hover crossfade has no rear image | blocked on plan §12 input #4 (real fleet photography) |
| 22 | PROMPT 05 not applied | the migrations are written and self-consistent but have **never run against the project**. Nothing in task 8 (counts, anon-RLS proof, overlap proof) can be reported as measured until they do | apply 0001-0006 in the SQL editor, do the two dashboard steps, `npm run db:seed`, then run 0007 |
| 21 | `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | never supplied, so `.env.local` still has the Supabase block commented out and the seed has only been dry-run | paste the key; I write `.env.local` (gitignored) and run the seed |
| 20 | `bookings` vs `reservations` | the starter's `bookings` table is untouched and still backs the current lead form; `reservations` is canonical from here | migrate the funnel in PROMPT 09, then drop `bookings` |
| 19 | places & supplementary services | owner's requirement (Sept 2026): chauffeur and delivery are extras on the **subtotal** (already how `pricing.quote()` works); places must be admin-managed and may be in **other Moroccan cities** (kind `city`, new `city` column in locations.csv, no city pre-filled) | PROMPT 05 schema step 0 · PROMPT 12 step 1b |
| 18 | admin fleet gallery | owner's requirement (Sept 2026): add / replace / remove / reorder photos per car from the admin, per angle; first photo = card image; silhouette fallback when empty. Data model already carries `images[]` + `photoFolder` per vehicle | PROMPT 12 (plan §7.1 updated, PROMPTS.md prompt 12 step 1) |
| 26 | `next_available()` probed at the wrong instant | Found by the new tests, present in BOTH implementations. The probe walked to `upper(period)`, but `free_units()` widens the *request* backwards by the prep buffer too, so a request starting exactly at that end still overlapped it. Every candidate looked occupied and the function returned **null** — the vehicle page would have printed nothing where "disponible à partir du 13 SEP" belongs | fixed in 0008 and `demo-availability.js`: probe at `upper(period) + prep_buffer`, which is two buffers clear of the return — exactly the clearance the exclusion constraint enforces. Pinned by a test |
| 27 | realtime subscribes to `availability_ping`, not `holds`/`reservations` | Plan 6.4 names the two tables directly, but Realtime honours RLS: delivering those rows to a visitor needs an anon SELECT policy, and any policy loose enough to deliver the row also delivers `customer_id`, the travel dates and the stored `quote`. Discarding it client-side is no help — it has already crossed the wire | **deviation from plan 6.4, deliberate.** 0008 adds a two-column table (`vehicle_id`, `updated_at`) written by triggers on holds/reservations/blocks. It says "something moved, ask again"; `/api/availability` stays the only thing that decides what a visitor may know. Plan §6.4 wants a one-line amendment |
| 28 | stale `next start` served phantom test failures | A `next start` left running from an earlier step kept port 3000 and served a build predating the new routes, so all 9 API tests 404'd and, earlier, 12 e2e tests "failed" against unchanged code | no code change; noted because it cost two debugging rounds. Kill the listener on 3000 before trusting an e2e run |
| 17 | `/livraison`, `/automatique` | in the header Services dropdown but the routes do not exist until PROMPT 13; rendered with a "bientôt" marker rather than a dead link | PROMPT 13 |

## Measured on the live database — 2026-09-07

Project `vmodgrkxiitwwneqhtbo` (`diabcar`), region **eu-central-1 / Frankfurt** — note plan §9.2 asked for West EU / Paris. Still EU, which is what the CNDP out-of-Morocco transfer wording turns on, so recorded rather than changed.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Schema objects | 20 tables · 1 view · 39 policies · 25 triggers · **2 exclusion constraints** · btree_gist · pg_cron |

| Realtime | `availability_ping` is in the `supabase_realtime` publication |
| pg_cron | `diabcar-expire-holds` scheduled `* * * * *`, active |
| App on Postgres | `/api/health` reports `mode: supabase`; `/fr`, `/ar`, `/fr/vehicules` render; **e2e 21/21 against Postgres as well as demo** |

The homepage drops its Reviews section in Supabase mode and keeps it in demo — correct, and the clearest demonstration of rule 11 so far: all four seeded reviews are unpublished samples, so anon receives none and the section deletes itself rather than showing a thin row.

## PROMPT 07 notes — 2026-09-07

**ISR vs `noindex`, resolved in the proxy.** Reading `searchParams` in the page or its `generateMetadata` opts the whole route out of static rendering, so the two requirements — "static shell (ISR)" and "parametrised URLs are noindex" — cannot both be met in the page. The page therefore never touches `searchParams` (the island reads the URL itself) and `src/proxy.js` sets `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, follow` on any request carrying a query string. Google honours the header exactly like the meta tag, and it works on a cached response. Measured: `/fr/vehicules` has no header, `/fr/vehicules?from=…` returns `noindex, follow`, and the route builds as `● … 1h`.

**Bugs found while wiring it up**

| # | Bug | Why it mattered |
|---|---|---|
| 29 | `pickup` was validated as a fee category (`agency\|airport\|…`) but the booking module puts a LOCATION KEY in the URL (`agence-zerktouni`) | every real search 400'd and the results page showed zero cars. The same mismatch made `submitBooking` look up `locations.find(l => l.key === 'agency')`, which never matched, so **every reservation was stored with a null `pickup_location_id`**. Fixed with one resolver, `src/lib/locations.js`, used by both routes and the action |
| 30 | the island's URL writer ran before `useSyncExternalStore` adopted the query string | on first render the store returns the SERVER snapshot (empty), so `replaceState` wiped the search before it was read — the page silently forgot the dates it had just been given. The URL is now input-only until the first interaction |
| 31 | `pick`/`drop` were referenced inside the `Promise.all` that produced them | a TDZ error the route's own try/catch turned into a silent 500 |
| 32 | footer wordmark link had no accessible name; results count failed contrast on the active chip; card `<h3>` followed `<h1>` with no `<h2>` | **a11y was 92 on the fleet page and 97 on the home page. All three fixed → 100 on both** |

**Not met: Lighthouse ≥ 90 on the bare fleet page.** Measured 57 before optimisation, **73 after** (LCP 4.37 → 3.39 s). Lazy-loading the booking module behind the "✎ Modifier" sheet (`next/dynamic`, `ssr:false`, gated on first open because a `<dialog>` renders its children while closed) is what bought most of that. What remains is TBT — site-wide JS execution, not this page's markup — and the homepage sits at the same 63–69 on unchanged code. This is the "performance budget CI" work in Sprint 6, not something the results page can fix alone. Readings still swing ±40 % on this machine (home measured 37 and 69 in the same session).

## PROMPT 08 notes — 2026-09-08

**The three "known bugs" in the prompt, checked rather than assumed**

| Bug | Finding |
|---|---|
| "Kilométrage kilométrage illimité" | **Not present.** `vehicle.includedItems.mileage` already reads `{mileage} inclus` in all four locales, and no label is paired with the value. Rendered output is `KILOMÉTRAGE ILLIMITÉ INCLUS` (screenshot in the report). Nothing to change |
| truncated time select | **Was still real.** The prompt said "now replaced by chips, verify" — chips replaced it in `BookingWidget` only; `VehicleQuote` still used `<Select>`. The vehicle page no longer renders `VehicleQuote`; its dates come from the module in a sheet, which uses chips. `VehicleQuote.js` is now dead on this route and is a delete candidate once the funnel stops using it |
| FAB overlap | **Structurally impossible now.** `WhatsAppFab` already returned null on `/vehicules/`, which STATUS called a workaround — plan 4.6 actually specifies it ("the WhatsApp FAB hides on this page"), because the booking panel and the mobile bar both carry WhatsApp. Verified: `animate-ping` (a FAB-only class) is absent from the vehicle HTML and present on the home page, and an e2e test asserts it |

**Also fixed:** `vehicleInquiryMessage(locale)` with no rental rendered "réserver la **undefined**" (STATUS issue 4). The `= {}` default only fires when the whole argument is missing. Fixed with a per-language fallback that carries its own determiner, plus the price clause plan 4.6 asks for — three regression tests.

**Static Open Graph cards (plan 9.3).** `npm run og` writes `public/og/<locale>/<slug>.png` — 108 cards, 27 vehicles × 4 locales, 8.2 MB — and a manifest `src/lib/seo.js` imports statically, so `ogImageUrl` returns the file when it exists and falls back to the dynamic route otherwise. It generates them by asking the running site for each card rather than importing the renderer: `src/lib/og.js` is JSX, which bare Node cannot parse, and a JSX transform would be a new dependency for one build step. Driving the real route also means there is no second implementation to drift.

**Honest gaps, by design**

- Only `front` exists in the photo pipeline, so the gallery renders one image: the EXTÉRIEUR | INTÉRIEUR toggle and the thumbnail strip appear only when those photos exist. An empty INTÉRIEUR tab would be rule 11 in UI form. Both light up with no code change once `side`/`rear`/`interior`/`dash` land in `docs/inputs/photos/<slug>/`.
- No FAQ is vehicle-scoped yet (none carry `category = vehicle` or a `vehicle_id`, and 9 of 10 seeded rows are unpublished TODOs), so the page falls back to the general published set, capped at 4. `FAQPage` is emitted for exactly what renders — Google requires the structured data to match the visible text.

**Not met: Lighthouse ≥ 90 / LCP ≤ 2.0 s.** Vehicle page measures **Performance 66, Accessibility 100, Best practices 100, SEO 100**; LCP 3.5–4.2 s, TBT 0.9–1.8 s. Same cause as the fleet page: site-wide JS execution under 4× CPU throttle. Sprint 6's performance budget work.

---

## PROMPT 09 notes — 2026-09-08

**Where funnel state lives, and why it is split.** The URL carries step, dates, place, car and chosen extras — shareable and restorable, and the back button works. sessionStorage carries the hold and the customer's name, phone and e-mail. **Personal data never enters a URL:** URLs land in history, in the `Referer` of every third-party request the page makes, in analytics and in screenshots sent to support. Plan 9.4 and Loi 09-08 both say collect the minimum and do not spread it around. The funnel restores completely on reload without a phone number ever appearing in the address bar.

**The confirmation page never reads the database.** `reservations` is staff-only under RLS (0005). Adding an anonymous read keyed by reference would let anyone who guessed a `DC-` code see a stranger's dates and pick-up point, so the funnel hands the confirmation its own figures through sessionStorage instead. Asserted: the server HTML for `?ref=DC-NOPE12` contains no `data-testid="confirmation"`, no `booking-reference` and no `data-car-transition` — the server emits only the loading line. The reference echoed back is shape-checked against `/^DC-[A-Z0-9-]{4,20}$/` rather than reflected raw.

**Turnstile is verified server-side and skipped when unconfigured**, and `submitBooking` reports which happened (`turnstile: 'verified' | 'skipped'`) so it can be asserted rather than assumed. If Cloudflare is unreachable the booking is allowed through and the failure logged — their outage should not become a funnel that cannot take a reservation.

**WOW-3 hook placed early.** `data-car-transition={slug}` is on the funnel summary and on the confirmation's car line. PROMPT 14 attaches the `view-transition-name` to it without touching this markup. An e2e test asserts the attribute exists.

**Two bugs found by running it**

| Bug | Finding |
|---|---|
| the funnel leaked live holds | The first e2e run left **9 live holds** in the database — a visitor who picks a car and then goes back was silently holding a unit. `goToStep` now releases on the way back, and the test asserts the timer disappears. Self-healing anyway (expiry + pg_cron), but it was quietly eating capacity |
| orphan notifications | Each booking writes an admin-bell row; deleting test reservations left rows pointing at nothing. Test cleanup now removes notifications whose `href` names a reservation that no longer exists — matched by id, not by text, because the text is indistinguishable from a real booking's |

Two of my own test assertions were wrong rather than the code: `toContainText('MAD')` fails in Arabic because `formatMAD` renders **درهم**, and `not.toContain('MAD')` on the confirmation matched the footer's `aria-label="MAD / EUR"` currency toggle — site chrome, not data.

**Verified after a full e2e run: 0 reservations, 0 customers, 0 live holds, 0 notifications** — the database is exactly as it was before.

---

## PROMPT 10 notes — 2026-09-08

A read-only audit (5 parallel agents) ran before any code was written. It found two things that would have made the whole rebuild look finished while doing nothing.

**BLOCKER 1 — the admin was reading with an anonymous client.** `selectAll`/`selectOne` in the Supabase adapter use `createPublicClient()`. Every staff-only table — reservations, units, customers, blocks, holds, events, notifications, audit_log — denies anon under the 0005 policies, and PostgREST answers with an **empty array and no error**. The admin would have rendered "0 réservations" over a full database. Fixed with `selectAllAsStaff`/`selectOneAsStaff` on the session client, and an e2e test asserts the fleet total is non-zero precisely to catch a regression.

**BLOCKER 2 — the role claim was ignored.** `claimsAreAdmin` checked `app_metadata.role === 'admin'` or an ADMIN_EMAILS allowlist, but the access-token hook enabled in PROMPT 05 emits **`user_role`** from `profiles.role`. The owner account would have been rejected unless its address happened to be on the list. `roleFromClaims` now reads `user_role` first and keeps both old paths as compatibility, mapping them to `owner`.

**Roles (plan 7.2).** `requireRole()` for actions (throws), `requirePageRole()` / `requirePricingRole()` for pages (redirect). `/tarifs`, `/parametres` and `/seo` are guarded server-side AND hidden from the nav for an agent — hiding alone is decoration, since typing the URL would still work.

**Notifications are real now (0009).** Triggers on reservation insert, on the status changes worth interrupting someone for (cancelled, no-show, returned — `confirmed`/`ready` stay quiet on purpose), and on a unit going to maintenance. `notifications` added to the realtime publication; the missing INSERT policy added. `operations_due()` defines "late" next to the data, and `/api/cron/reminders` turns it into rows — **idempotently**, verified: run 1 created 1, run 2 created 0 for the same overdue return.

**Bug found by the test, then fixed properly.** The bell did not move over Realtime. `postgres_changes` is RLS-filtered, and the socket was connecting before the session was attached, so the subscription was accepted and silently delivered nothing. `realtime.setAuth(access_token)` before `subscribe()`. The bell now reports `data-live` so it degrades honestly and the test waits for SUBSCRIBED instead of racing it — a missed INSERT is never redelivered, which is why it was intermittent.

**NOT DONE — stated plainly**

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Web Push transport | **Not built.** VAPID keys are generated (`npm run vapid`, Web Crypto, no dependency) and stored in `.env.local`; `.env.example` documents them. The service worker, the aes128gcm sender, the subscribe button in Système, `push_subscriptions` CRUD and the admin-scoped PWA manifest are all outstanding. The in-app bell works today; nothing reaches a phone that is not looking at the page |
| 8 of plan 3's routes | `/calendrier`, `/blocs`, `/clients`, `/operations/departs`, `/operations/retours`, `/systeme` now render an honest "pas encore disponible" panel naming the prompt that builds them and what to use meanwhile — the nav links to them, and a 404 would read as a broken admin. `/operations/checklist/[id]` and `/flotte/unites/[id]` have no link and no page |
| Global search | The input, the `/` shortcut and the submit exist; it routes to `/reservations?q=`. The reservations page does not yet interpret `q`, so searching currently filters nothing |
| Admin still reads the LEGACY `bookings` table | `/admin/reservations` lists `bookings`, not `reservations`. The dashboard reads the real `reservations`. Migrating that page is PROMPT 11 |

## Final sweep — what was checked, and what could not be (2026-09-08)

**The adversarial bug-hunt workflow did not run. Three attempts, three failures on the session /
model limit** — 6 reviewers each time, 0 started. Its result reads `confirmed: []`, and that means
**zero reviewers ran, not zero bugs**. It is recorded here so nobody mistakes an empty list for a
clean bill of health. Worth re-running after 19:20 Africa/Casablanca.

The audit was therefore done by hand, plus one new permanent guard.

**New: `npm run check:i18n`** (`scripts/check-i18n-keys.mjs`). `check:messages` proves the four
locales AGREE; it never reads the code, so it cannot prove the code only asks for keys that exist.
That gap put a raw `faqPage.categories.documents` heading on the live FAQ page while four suites
were green. The new check walks `src/app`, `src/components` and `src/lib`, resolves each translator
to its namespace and verifies every literal key. **491 keys, all present.**

It found its own bug first: the initial version reported 11 missing keys that all exist, because
`const t` is legitimately rebound per function — `seo.faq` inside `generateMetadata`, `faqPage`
inside the component — and it was resolving against the LAST declaration in the file rather than the
nearest preceding one. Fixed, then proved on a planted key.

**Checked by hand, nothing found:**

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Every static route × 4 locales, on a live dev server | **56/56 return 200** |
| i18n errors during that sweep | **zero** (the 18-per-page flood is gone) |
| Rule 3, physical CSS in public components | clean — the one hit, `left-1/2` with `-translate-x-1/2`, is the correct direction-safe centring idiom; `start-1/2` would actually break it in RTL |
| Rule 2, raw hex | clean — the remaining three are `themeColor`/manifest metadata, which cannot take a CSS variable, and the Google brand mark, which must keep its own colours |
| `toCamel` and column names containing digits | only `is_24h` was ever broken (fixed); `airport_service24h` has no underscore before the digit and always mapped correctly. `toSnake` stays asymmetric on purpose — every write carrying that key goes through an RPC that reads it by name |

**Suites:** build pass · lint at the 10-error baseline · 99/99 unit · contrast, messages (833 × 4),
css and i18n-keys all pass · **106/108 e2e with 2 flaky, both green on retry**.

**Known flakes, named rather than hidden:** the `/es` homepage sub-resource 404, and the closed-loop
test — which books a window starting thirty minutes out, so it is genuinely timing-sensitive. Both
pass on retry; neither has ever failed twice in a row.

## Per-car booking sheet — owner's revision (2026-09-08)

The owner sent screenshots of a competing flow and asked for the same shape: pick a CAR, see a
calendar of the days THAT car is free, choose the pick-up place from priced option cards, then
options, then coordinates. Three steps, one sheet.

**The rule that shaped it.** A per-day free count is a HINT, not the answer. Three units where A
is free Mon–Wed and B Wed–Fri leave every day « free » while no single unit covers Mon–Fri, and
the exclusion constraint is per unit. So the calendar paints days from `vehicle_availability_days()`
and the RANGE is settled by `/api/quote` — which asks `free_units()` for that exact window —
before the continue button opens. The sheet never decides availability (rule 5).

Verified on the live database with a realistic 10:00→10:00 rental over 19–21 Oct: days 19, 20 and
21 grey (out, plus the return day for turnaround), 18 and 22 free. An earlier probe that booked
midnight-to-midnight greyed three days for a one-day rental — an artefact of the test, not the code,
caught before it became a « fix ».

**Migration `0013_vehicle_calendar.sql`** (applied): `casablanca_day()` and
`vehicle_availability_days(vehicle, from, to)` — public, capped at 92 days per call, `NOT_FOUND`
for an unpublished car, and it returns a free-count per day and nothing else: no plate, no unit
status, no reservation, no customer (plan 6.5, asserted by an e2e test).

**The gap that would have made the priced place cards lie.** `quote()` only ever knew
`airportDeliveryFee` and `cityDeliveryFee`, so a screen showing Casablanca +300 / Marrakech +500 /
Agadir +700 would have billed all three the same. Each place now charges its own
`delivery_fee_mad`, with null still meaning « sur devis » rather than a free delivery nobody agreed
to (rule 11). Seven tests pin it — including one that pins the OLD behaviour for the `station`
category, which my first version silently started charging 150 MAD for.

**Payment: unchanged, and stated on screen.** The screenshots show an online payment step. Plan
§9.5 is a locked decision — no online payment — and everything downstream rests on it: `pending`
means a human confirms, prompt 12 built cash/TPE capture at the counter, and the auto-expiry sweep
exists because nobody pays online. Step 3 collects coordinates and says plainly that payment happens
at the agency. An e2e test asserts no card field ever appears. **If Diab Car wants real card
payments, that is a provider, a merchant account and PCI scope — its own prompt, with a line in the plan.**

**Also:** `/reservation` stays alive as the deep-link target and the no-JS path; both flows write
through the same `submitBooking`. Age and country became optional there — a reservation is a
REQUEST, and the licence is checked against the physical document by the pickup checklist that
refuses to complete without « identité vérifiée ». The minimum-age rule still runs whenever an age
is supplied.

**Two bugs of my own, caught before they shipped:** `isoDay()` crashed the whole sheet on open
(`addDays` handed it a number, it called `.getTime()`); and the React Compiler rejected `setState`
inside both effects — fixed by DERIVING « is it loading » and « which inputs is this price for » from
a key stamped on the answer, so a price can never outlive the dates it was calculated for.

**Checks:** build pass · lint at the 10-error baseline · **99/99** unit (+7 delivery-fee) · contrast,
messages (**833 keys × 4**, zero placeholder mismatches) and css pass · **108/108 e2e**, including 7
new ones: the route leaks nothing, an unknown car gets nothing, a backwards range is refused, the
three steps walk and price, no payment field exists, a fully-booked day reads 0, and the sheet works
in Arabic RTL with Western digits.

**Open:** the sheet is mounted on the vehicle page. Putting it on every fleet card as well needs
`locations`/`extras`/labels threaded into `VehicleCard`, which is worth doing but is plumbing, not
design — next pass.

---
## Fix — two bugs `npm run dev` reported and every suite missed (2026-09-08)

Running the dev server after the CSS fixes produced 18 i18n errors per page view and one
missing message. Build, lint, 92 unit tests, three checks and 101 e2e tests were all green
at the time.

**1. The FAQ page rendered a raw translation key to customers.** `/fr/faq` shipped
`<h2>faqPage.categories.documents</h2>` — the key itself, as the heading of the only section
on the page. Cause: `t(\`categories.${c}\`)` builds a translation key out of DATABASE content,
and prompt 12's FAQ editor lets staff type any category they like, while the message files are
static and shipped six. `check:messages` could not catch it — it proves the four locales agree,
not that the code only asks for keys that exist. Fixed at the root: an unlabelled category now
falls back to its humanised slug, so a category invented tomorrow reads « Carburant » rather
than a key; and `documents` — which the live data actually uses, and which plan §8.5 lists — got
a real label in all four locales. The full §8.5 vocabulary lands with the FAQ import in prompt 13;
the fallback covers it until then.

**2. Every fleet page logged 18 formatting errors.** The results page hands label TEMPLATES to a
client island, which interpolates them itself — `labels.showMore.replace('{n}', …)`. Fetching
them with `t()` asks next-intl to format a message whose values are deliberately absent, so it
logged `FORMATTING_ERROR` for each and fell back to returning the raw string. The UI was correct
the whole time, resting on an error path. Nine call sites now use `t.raw()`, which is the
documented way to ask for an unformatted message. The dev log for those pages is silent.

The second one is worth stating plainly: **that noise is how a real bug hides.** The CSS parse
failure fixed earlier the same day sat in the same log.

**Also committed:** the `<!-- BEGIN:nextjs-agent-rules -->` block Next.js 16 writes into
CLAUDE.md on every `next dev`. It re-creates itself if deleted, so committing it once is what
keeps the tree clean; the alternative is `agentRules: false` in next.config.mjs, which would
also suppress a true warning about Next 16 differing from training data.

**Verified:** `/fr/faq` renders « Documents » and `/ar/faq` « الوثائق »; zero i18n errors in the dev
log across four page loads; build pass · lint at the 10-error baseline · 92/92 unit · contrast,
messages (765 keys × 4) and css pass · 100/101 e2e with one known homepage flake.

## Full verification of the booking pop-up (2026-09-09)

« Run and verify no errors at all ». Everything was run, and a five-dimension
adversarial review (state, pricing, security, i18n/UI, integration — 20 agents,
each candidate defect then attacked by a skeptic) was run over the new code in
parallel. 12 findings survived refutation; all 12 are fixed, plus 2 the full
Playwright suite caught on its own. Details in commit `da7ed77`.

The ones that mattered most:

| what | why it mattered |
|---|---|
| demo calendar off by one day | every cell carried the PREVIOUS day's count, so demo mode blocked free days and offered booked ones (rule 12). Postgres was always right. |
| four booking buttons on the vehicle page | two red « Réserver » buttons went to WhatsApp, not to the booking flow. The panel now owns the pop-up; there is one Réserver per car. |
| the pop-up ignored the visitor's dates | arrived on `?from=&to=`, saw a price on the panel, then got a blank calendar. It now inherits them, splitting the ISO instant in Casablanca time so the moment is preserved exactly. |
| Turnstile token never sent | nothing is broken today because no keys are configured — but the day they are, `verifyTurnstile()` answers `missing-input-response` and EVERY booking fails. |
| `done` never cleared | after one successful booking, re-opening showed the old confirmation with no way to start a second one. |
| « Réessayer » never retried | `setMonth(m => m)` is a no-op React bails out of; the calendar stayed loading for ever. |
| no price per day | rule 4 says price per day AND total. Only the total was shown. |
| « sur devis » printed as 0 MAD | the agency e-mail and both admin surfaces read it as free, so the fee would never be collected. |
| Arabic letter-spaced | hand-rolled `uppercase tracking-wide` instead of `.text-meta`, which globals.css already neutralises for `ar` (rule 3). |

### Booked dates — the owner's specific request

A car booked X→Z must not offer those days and must show they are taken. There
is now a legend under the grid, and a test that proves it against a REAL
booking: it books out every unit, pages the calendar to that month, and asserts
each occupied day reports zero free units, is disabled, is labelled « déjà
réservé », and that a range straddling the blocked run is refused. **Mutation-
checked**: with the availability guard removed the test fails, so it is not
asserting vacuously.

### Numbers

Build passes · lint 9 errors + 1 warning, the documented baseline, every one in
a pre-existing file and **none in the booking code** · 111/111 unit · contrast,
messages (756 keys × 4), css, i18n-keys pass.

Full Playwright suite, both data modes:

| mode | passed | skipped | failed |
|---|---|---|---|
| supabase (real config) | 81 | 11 | 0 |
| demo (rule 12) | 79 | 13 | 0 |

The 11–13 skips are the admin/loop/reservations specs, which need
`E2E_ADMIN_PASSWORD`; that is not set here and they say so rather than passing
vacuously.

**Correction to an earlier note in this file's history:** the e2e suite CAN
reach the live database — `tests/e2e/helpers/db.js` loads `.env.local` itself,
so `db.available` is true regardless of the shell environment. The specs that
write use the marker address `e2e-…@example.invalid` and delete their rows in a
`finally`. Checked after every run: zero marker rows, zero test reservations.

### One unexplained flake

`home.spec.js › /es renders every section without console errors` failed once
in one full run and passed on the two subsequent full runs and a targeted run.
Playwright had already cleared the artefact by then, so the console message was
lost and the cause is unknown. Recorded rather than dismissed.

### Left deliberately

`src/lib/actions/availability.js` (`holdVehicle`, `releaseHold`) is orphaned
since the funnel was deleted. A 10-minute soft lock during checkout is a
plausible addition to this pop-up, so it is flagged, not removed.

---

## The booking pop-up — the owner's new flow (2026-09-09)

The owner asked for the old reservation system to be removed **entirely**
and described its replacement: each car has a « Réserver » button; it
opens a pop-up in the middle of the screen; step 1 is the dates with the
total at the bottom and a next button; step 2 is a multi-choice of
delivery destinations *set from the admin with their prices*, plus other
options they can add later; step 3 is the confirmation, where the client
writes their full name and phone and sees the total with everything.
Reference screenshots followed for the LAYOUT (named step tabs, a car
card, a « Période de location » card with « Modifier », `+300,00 MAD`
rows with a tick, hatched unavailable days).

Not taken from the reference: online payment (plan §9.5 says none), the
competitor's trust badge, and their green — the palette stays on tokens.

### What was removed, in two commits before the build

Thirteen files: `/reservation`, `/reservation/confirmation` and the six
funnel components (prompt 09), the per-car quickbook sheet and
`/api/vehicle-calendar`, and two e2e specs. Then two orphans a sweep
found still pointing at the deleted addresses, `BookingForm.js` and
`VehicleQuote.js`, neither of which was rendered anywhere.

Kept deliberately: the `reservations` table, the availability RPCs,
`/api/quote`, `/api/availability`, `pricing.js` and the whole admin. Those
are not "the way of reservation" — 34 admin files and 10 migrations run on
them. Migration 0013 stayed too; only its route had gone, so restoring
`/api/vehicle-calendar` for the new calendar was a file, not a migration.

### The admin half already existed

Nothing new was needed for "I set the destinations and their prices, and
add other options later". Prompt 12 shipped it: `locations` rows carry
`delivery_fee_mad`, `save_location()` writes them with a mandatory reason,
and `/admin/tarifs` has « Ajouter le lieu » and « Ajouter l'option ». The
pop-up simply READS that catalogue at open time through the new
`/api/booking-options`, so a row added in the dashboard reaches customers
with no deploy and the component knows nothing about any given option.

### A production pricing bug, found by running the endpoint

Every delivery destination was quoting **0 MAD**. `locations` has two fee
columns: `delivery_fee_mad`, which the admin writes, and the starter's
`fee`, `numeric default 0`. The adapter read `deliveryFeeMad ?? fee ??
null` — so an unpriced place answered 0 — and `deliveryFeeFor()` then
computed `Number(null ?? null)`, which is 0 as well. The live table is
exactly that shape:

```
key                       kind       fee   delivery_fee_mad
agence-zerktouni          agency     0     0        <- genuinely free
aeroport-mohammed-v       airport    0     null     <- « sur devis »
maarif / anfa / ain-diab / centre-ville / casa-voyageurs / sidi-maarouf
                          district   0     null     <- « sur devis »
```

So the site was promising free delivery to Aïn Diab, to Anfa and to
Mohammed V, and the agency would have had to absorb the cost or charge at
the counter for something the page never showed — rule 11 and rule 4 in
one line. Migration 0002 had the rule right when it backfilled only
`where fee > 0`; that test now lives in `deliveryFeeOf()` and both call
sites go through it.

Why every existing test missed it: each one builds a location by hand with
a single `deliveryFee` key, and on that shape `deliveryFee ??
deliveryFeeMad` is `null ?? undefined` = undefined, which reads correctly
as "unset". A row off the wire carries BOTH keys, both null. The new tests
use a real row.

### Two bugs found by running the UI rather than reading it

- **« Continuer vers les détails » submitted the form.** React reused one
  `<button>` for next and submit, `setStep` flushed synchronously during
  the click, and the browser ran that click's default action on the node
  it had just turned into a submit button. Step 3 opened with "indiquez
  votre nom complet" under a field nobody had been given the chance to
  fill. Fixed with distinct keys; pinned by a test.
- **The calendar never filled in development.** The month dedupe lives in
  a ref, which survives an effect teardown, while the `alive` flag does
  not — so under StrictMode the second pass skipped the fetch the first
  pass had already disowned. All three effects now let their answers land.

Also fixed while looking at screenshots: `.text-meta` is a LABEL style
(uppercase, 0.12em tracking) and had been used on car names and whole
sentences; red was on the progress bar, the period card AND the primary
button, past the 5% of rule 2; and a Latin street address inside the
Arabic page reordered to "boulevard Zerktouni 356" until it was wrapped
in `<bdi>`.

### Verified

Build passes · lint at the 9-error baseline (10 → 9: one error lived in a
deleted orphan) · **111/111 unit** (99 + 9 for `locations` + 2 for the
real-row fee shape) · contrast, messages (803 keys × 4), css and
i18n-keys all pass.

`tests/e2e/reserve.spec.js` passes in **both** data modes. It drives the
full submit on the demo store — asserting a real `DC-…` reference — and
stops at an armed confirm button when `/api/health` reports `supabase`,
so a test run cannot leave fake customers in the agency's Postgres
(rule 10). Confirmed afterwards that it did not: the test phone is absent
from the live `customers` table.

Screenshots checked at every step in light, dark and Arabic RTL.

### Open

- The delivery destinations all read « sur devis » until the owner sets
  their prices on `/admin/tarifs` → Lieux. That is now the truth rather
  than a wrong 0, but it is the one thing waiting on the owner.
- `extras` is empty in the live database, so step 2 shows "aucune option".
  Adding one on `/admin/tarifs` makes it appear with no deploy.
- « Réserver » is on the vehicle page. Whether it should also sit on every
  fleet CARD is a judgement call left open: the card is a server component
  with a whole-card overlay link, so a button there needs care.

## Fix — the button sweep never reversed in Arabic (2026-09-08)

**Symptom** (reported from `npm run dev`, any URL, any locale): the dev overlay refused
`src/styles/globals.css` outright — *Parsing CSS source code failed … Unexpected token in
attribute selector: Dimension { value: 0.1, unit: "s_var" }* at line 3832 of the generated
stylesheet. `npm run build` had never failed on it; it printed *Found 2 warnings while
optimizing generated CSS* and carried on.

**Cause.** One line of `globals.css` targeted a Tailwind arbitrary-value utility by writing
the class name straight into a selector, unescaped:

```text
[dir="rtl"] .motion-safe<COLON>animate-<the animation shorthand in brackets> { … }
```

(written here with the colon and the brackets spelled out on purpose — see the
second fix below for why a real class name in a comment is itself a bug)

CSS reads `:animate-` as a pseudo-class and `[button-sweep_1.1s…]` as an attribute selector,
so this is not a wrong rule — it is not a rule. Lightning CSS (what Turbopack parses CSS with)
dropped it and warned; `next dev` refused the sheet. **The consequence nobody had noticed: the
RTL mirroring it existed to perform had never once applied.** Plan §4.12 requires motion
direction to reverse in Arabic; the sweep inside every busy button ran left-to-right in all
four languages since the rule was written.

**Fix.** A real class, which is what the other three RTL reversals in the same file already use
(`.road-dash`, `.vcard-scan`, `.redline-loading`):

```css
.btn-sweep { animation: button-sweep 1.1s var(--ease-inout) infinite; }
[dir="rtl"] .btn-sweep { animation-direction: reverse; }
```

`Button.js` and `BookingWidget.js` now use `btn-sweep`. The `motion-safe:` variant is dropped
because the global `prefers-reduced-motion` block already zeroes every duration and iteration
count (rule 6) — the same thing `.road-dash` relies on, and its comment says so.

**Second fix, same day: the guard was checking the wrong file.** The first version of
`scripts/check-css.mjs` parsed the stylesheet *as written*. That is not where Tailwind bugs
live. Tailwind v4 scans EVERY file in the project for anything that looks like a class name -
including code comments, including that script's own header, where the broken selector had been
pasted as an illustration with `var(...)` abbreviated. Tailwind dutifully generated a utility
for it, `animation: button-sweep 1.1s var(...)`, which is not valid CSS, and the build failed
on a rule no human wrote at a line in a file that does not exist on disk. The source-only guard
passed the whole time.

`check:css` now runs in two stages: the sheet as written, then the sheet **after the real
PostCSS + Tailwind pipeline has generated it**. Proved by re-introducing the exact string in a
scratch file: the guard fails with the build's own message (`Unexpected token Delim('.')` at
generated line 2898) and passes when it is removed. The remaining illustrations in this file and
in `globals.css` are now written in prose for the same reason.

The lesson, which is the actual finding: **a comment in this repo is executable.** A plausible
class name written anywhere - a `.js`, a `.mjs`, a `.md` - becomes CSS.

**Guard.** `npm run check:css` (new, `scripts/check-css.mjs`) parses every stylesheet with
Lightning CSS — already inside Tailwind v4, so no new dependency — and fails on any warning
that is not one of Tailwind's own at-rules. It exits 1 on the old file and 0 on the new one.
Added to the definition of done.

**Verified:** the built CSS now contains `[dir=rtl] .btn-sweep{animation-direction:reverse}`;
before the fix that rule was absent from the output entirely. build pass · lint at the 10-error
baseline · 92/92 unit · contrast, messages and css all pass · **101/101 e2e**.

## PROMPT 12 notes — 2026-09-08

**The closed loop, measured on the live database, not assumed.** `free_units()` for one model across the loop:

| Step | free units | unit | reservation |
|---|---|---|---|
| before | 2 | available | — |
| booked + confirmed | 1 | available | confirmed |
| **complete_pickup** | 1 | **rented** | **active** |
| **complete_return** | held by the cleaning block | **cleaning** | **returned** |
| **mark_unit_ready** | **back on sale** | **available** | returned |

Why a block and not the status: `unit_is_bookable()` (0008) is period-blind — it excludes maintenance | blocked | out_of_service for EVERY window, past and future. Adding `cleaning` there would take a car being wiped down this afternoon off sale for next month too. Availability is a question about a PERIOD, so the answer is period-shaped: `complete_return` writes a `blocks` row of kind `cleaning` for `[now, now + settings.cleaning_minutes)`, `mark_unit_ready` deletes it, and `refresh_cleaning_blocks()` (pg_cron every 10 min, or `/api/cron/expire-reservations`) re-extends it while the status is still `cleaning`. If the cron never runs, the exposure is bounded by the same prep buffer the whole engine already trusts — stated, not hidden.

**Two pre-existing bugs found by the loop test, both real, both fixed in the file that owns them.**

1. **Every write to `blocks` had been failing since PROMPT 06.** `touch_availability_ping()` (0008) resolved `new.vehicle_id` inside a `CASE`; plpgsql plans the whole expression up front, `blocks` has no such column, and the AFTER trigger raised `record "new" has no field "vehicle_id"` — aborting the write. Prompt 11's « + Bloc » never worked; its only caller wrapped the insert in a `catch`. Rewritten through `to_jsonb()`.
2. **PROMPT 04's `log_reservation_transition()` already writes PICKUP/RETURN events**, so the checklists were producing two rows per handover in an append-only evidence table. The checklists now raise a transaction-local flag (`app.skip_transition_event`) and the trigger stands aside; it still fires for every other path.

**Migration `0012_fleet_ops_content.sql`** (applied): `vehicle_photos` table (public read, staff write); `settings.{auto_expire_hours, cleaning_minutes, deposit_by_category, sla, last_backup_at, payment_methods, verified_claims}`; `reservations.payment` (what was actually taken at the counter, audited); RPCs `save_vehicle`, `save_unit`, `set_unit_status`, `save_vehicle_photo`, `delete_vehicle_photo`, `reorder_vehicle_photos`, `unit_dossier`, `operations_day`, `complete_pickup`, `complete_return`, `mark_unit_ready`, `refresh_cleaning_blocks`, `expire_unconfirmed_reservations`, `save_season`, `save_extra`, `save_location`, `save_settings`, `save_faq`, `save_review`, `admin_delete` (literal whitelist), `system_metrics`. Audit triggers extended to seasons, extras, locations, faqs, reviews, posts, vehicle_photos. Verified as anon: every guarded function answers FORBIDDEN / `[]` / `null`.

**Rule 11 with teeth.** `public_settings` now NULLs `google_rating`, `google_review_count` and `founded_year` unless `verified_claims` marks them true — enforced in the VIEW, so no component can leak an unverified number even by asking for it. Consequence: « depuis 2013 » and the Google rating are OFF the public site until someone ticks « vérifié » in Paramètres. Plan §12.10 lists that claim as unconfirmed; this is the rule working. The demo adapter mirrors the gate (tested).

**`save_vehicle` / `save_unit` PATCH rather than overwrite** (proved: a partial save keeps `minDays`, `prepBufferMinutes`, `purposeTags`, mileage and fuel). Without this an older form would have reset the prep buffer — the thing that stops the same car being promised thirty minutes after a return — every time somebody fixed a typo.

**Images: no server processing anywhere.** `src/lib/images/browser.js` decodes, resizes on a canvas, encodes WebP at 480/768/1080/1600/2000 (never upscaling) plus a JPEG fallback and a 24 px blur, then uploads straight to the `vehicles` bucket. Inspection photos and signatures go to the private `inspections` bucket, read back through 15-minute signed URLs. `CarImage` renders a build-time manifest photo and an uploaded row with identical markup; the fleet, results, vehicle and airport pages now thread `vehicle_photos` through, one query per page.

**Admin routes now real:** `/flotte`, `/flotte/[id]` (content ×4, specs, purpose tags, prices, publish, photo manager), `/flotte/unites`, `/flotte/unites/[id]` (Aperçu · Timeline with evidence thumbnails · Réservations · Blocs · Documents placeholder), `/operations/departs`, `/operations/retours` (with overdue and à préparer), `/operations/checklist/[id]?mode=pickup|return` (three ticks, SVG condition map with 19 keyboard-reachable zones, photos, signature canvas, payment record), `/contenu/faq` (×4 languages, short + long answer, category/city/vehicle), `/contenu/avis` (first name + initial, sample flag explained), `/contenu/blog` list, `/tarifs` (seasons, unlimited tiers, extras, deposit by category, delivery per place, misc fees — every write with a reason), `/parametres` (agency, repeatable hour bands, legal/CNDP, trust numbers with « vérifié », SLA ×4, auto-expiry, cleaning minutes, backup date), `/systeme` (DB and storage against the free limits, counts, honest « not readable from here » for Workers requests and Resend quota), `/seo` (+ OG regeneration instructions). `/vehicules*` and `/avis` redirect.

**Fixed after the agents' cross-review** (each flagged in a file it did not own): `toCamel` never converted `is_24h`; `listLocations` returned `deliveryFeeMad` while the booking module read `deliveryFee`, so **every place rendered « sur devis » in production** while working in demo; `listVehicles`/`getVehicleById` read as anon so the admin could not see drafts; `save_settings` skipped `lat`/`lng`; `payment_methods` missing from `public_settings`; `unit_dossier` key naming; nav shortcut and role gating; a duplicate `upsertUnit` export that broke the build. Prompt 11's four reservation actions and the block delete gained zod (rule 1). Deleted as orphans: `VehicleForm.js`, `SettingsForm.js`, `BookingStatusForm.js` and twelve dead FormData actions in `actions/admin.js`.

## PROMPT 11 notes — 2026-09-08

**The whole point: the admin has no side door.** Every operational write goes through an RPC that
re-checks `is_staff()` and re-runs the same conflict test the exclusion constraint would: a booking
taken at the counter for the last car is refused with the same message and the same alternatives a
customer gets, and a bar dragged onto another booking on the calendar does not move. Two Playwright
tests exist to say exactly that, and both pass.

**Closed from PROMPT 10.** `/admin/reservations` now reads the real `reservations` table instead of
the legacy `bookings` one, and the global search box finally does something: `?q=` matches a
reference, a customer name, a phone, an e-mail or a model. `/calendrier` and `/clients` are real
pages, not placeholders.

**Security fix found while writing 0010.** `has_role()` returned `NULL` for a caller with no JWT,
because `NULL = any(roles)` is NULL, not false. In plpgsql `if not NULL then …` does **not** fire, so
a guard written as `if not can_manage_pricing() then return FORBIDDEN` FELL THROUGH to the privileged
path — `override_reservation_price` succeeded unauthenticated. Fixed with `coalesce(…, false)` in
`0005_roles_rls.sql`; verified: `has_role('{owner}')` → false and `can_manage_pricing()` → false with
no JWT, and all four customer functions in 0011 answer `FORBIDDEN`/`[]`/`null` to `anon`.

**Migrations applied to the live database.**

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `0010_reservation_ops.sql` | `reservation_next_states`, `set_reservation_status`, `assign_reservation_unit`, `move_reservation`, `override_reservation_price`, `units_free_for_reservation`, `calendar_rows`. `authenticated` only, each re-checking its own guard |
| `0011_customers.sql` | `phone_key` (+ index), `customer_duplicates`, `customer_profile`, `set_customer_notes`, `merge_customers` |

**Why each operation is ONE RPC.** `set_reason()` is transaction-scoped and PostgREST runs one
transaction per request, so "set the reason, then write" from the app would lose the reason before the
audit trigger ever saw it. Verified end to end: the reason reaches `audit_log` for a status change, a
price override, a date move and a customer merge.

**Conflicts are answers, not errors.** Every RPC looks the conflict up *before* it writes, so the
payload names the booking in the way and its dates — « CONFLIT — DC-260908-XXXX occupe déjà cette
voiture du 10 au 15 sept » — which is what lets an operator solve the problem. The server actions
return these outcomes instead of throwing.

**The calendar is plain CSS grid and pointer events**, no library (rule 9). Drag-to-move and
drag-to-resize are expressed as a whole number of SLOTS, never as an absolute snap, so a 10:00 pick-up
is still 10:00 after being dragged a day later. Optimistic: the bar moves, Postgres is asked, and a
refusal drops the override so the bar returns to where the database says it is. The window maths lives
in `src/lib/calendar.js` with 20 tests against a fixed +01:00 Casablanca, so a server in UTC and a
laptop in Casablanca draw the same grid.

**Duplicate clients.** `customers.phone` is UNIQUE, so exact duplicates cannot exist — which is
precisely why the real ones do: `+212612345678` and `0612345678` are one human and three different
values. `phone_key()` (last nine digits) finds them; the merge moves the reservations first, then
deletes, inheriting only what the survivor was missing. `customers` carries no audit trigger on
purpose (every public booking inserts one, and copying names and numbers into `audit_log` each time
would duplicate the customer table), so the merge writes its own journal row — by id and count, with
the reason, no PII.

**Verified on the live database**

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| anon calling the four 0011 functions | `[]`, `null`, `FORBIDDEN`, `FORBIDDEN` |
| `phone_key('+212 612-345678') = phone_key('0612345678')` | true |
| merge without a reason / onto itself | `REASON_REQUIRED` / `SAME` |
| merge of two files, one with a reservation | ok, `moved: 1`, survivor inherited the e-mail, notes joined, dropped row gone |
| journal after the merge | `DELETE` on `customers` with actor `57b71502…` and reason « fusion doublon », body = ids + count only |
| audit reason on the moved reservation | « doublon telephone » |

**Checks**

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` | pass |
| `npm run lint` | 10 errors, 1 warning — **exactly the pre-existing baseline**; every new file lints clean |
| `npm test` | **86 / 86 pass** (was 66; +20 from `src/lib/calendar.test.js`, plus the adapter-parity assertions picking up the new methods) |
| `npm run check:contrast` | pass — 56 / 56 |
| `npm run check:messages` | pass — 764 leaf keys × 4 locales |
| `npm run test:e2e` | 59 passed · 2 flaky (home 404 on a sub-resource, green on retry) · 1 flaky-to-failing: see below |

**NOT DONE / open — stated plainly**

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| The bell Realtime test | `admin.spec.js › a new reservation raises the bell without a reload` is **intermittent**. Alone it passes in ~6 s; after the five earlier tests in the same file it sometimes times out. Investigated rather than papered over: the notification trigger still fires (probed directly on the live DB — row created, `unread`), and the DOM shows no unread badge, so the `postgres_changes` event is not being delivered, not the trigger failing. A longer timeout does not fix it, so the timeout was reverted. Pre-existing from PROMPT 10; not caused by this prompt |
| Web Push transport | Still not built — unchanged from PROMPT 10 |
| `/operations/checklist/[id]`, `/flotte/unites/[id]` | Still no page (PROMPT 12) |
| `/blocs` page | Blocks can now be created and deleted from the calendar; the standalone `/blocs` list is still a placeholder (PROMPT 12) |
| Staff booking form | Deliberately quote-then-create, and the create button locks again if any pricing field changes. It does **not** yet offer extras quantities or a delivery address field |
| Lighthouse | Not re-measured; the admin is not in the public performance budget |

## Decisions §10 does not settle

Plan §10 groups files by area, so it is silent on a number of individual files. Each call below was derived from the
plan section named, and is recorded here so a later prompt inherits the reasoning instead of re-deriving it. Anything
marked **needs Yahya** is a product decision, not a technical one.

**Needs Yahya**

- ~~`src/app/(site)/[locale]/avec-chauffeur/page.js` — pending confirmation~~ **Resolved:** Diab Car's own announcement lists "professional driver on request". The route stays, plan §3 updated to P1.
- `public/images/cars/*.svg` — the six placeholder silhouettes. Marked **rebuild** because §2.5 needs two environments (pale ground / near-black with rim light); they become **delete** the day real fleet photography exists.
- Admin route relocations (§3 renames `/vehicules` → `/flotte`, moves `/avis` under `/contenu`). Recorded as **rebuild**; if a move counts as delete-then-create, those rows flip to **delete**.
- `docs/inputs/*` — still the empty intake contract from §12. Every unfilled file is a TODO that later prompts will stub rather than invent (CLAUDE.md rule 11).

**Derived, no decision needed**

<details>
<summary>All 52 derivations in full</summary>

- src/components/admin/SeoTools.js — marked `keep` rather than the group's `rebuild`. Section 10's Admin row reads "Rebuild IA to section 7; keep server actions pattern, forms, revalidate/IndexNow tools", and §7.1 lists the SEO tools as "existing: revalidate, IndexNow". This file IS the revalidate/IndexNow tool, so the carve-out names it directly. If the parent prefers strict group inheritance, flip it to `rebuild` — the functional change is nil either way (it only inherits btn-gold via ui.js SubmitButton).
- src/components/admin/BookingStatusForm.js, VehicleForm.js, PostForm.js, SettingsForm.js — same carve-out ("keep server actions pattern, forms") could be read as `keep`. I chose `rebuild` because each must change substantively for section 7 (units/plates/blocks, event+audit rows with reason, role gating) and for the new tokens; only the useActionState + server-action shape is reused.
- src/app/(admin)/admin/avis/page.js — `rebuild` assumes a route move to /contenu/avis (§3 admin URL map). If the parent counts a route relocation as delete-then-create, this is `delete`.
- src/app/(admin)/admin/vehicules/page.js and vehicules/[id]/page.js — same relocation question: §3 renames /vehicules to /flotte, /flotte/[id] and adds /flotte/unites/[id]. Kept as `rebuild` since section 10 groups them under Rebuild, but a `delete` reading is defensible.
- src/app/(admin)/admin/not-found.js and layout.js — section 10 covers them only via the blanket `src/app/(admin)/*` glob, and neither is part of the section 7 IA. `rebuild` is inherited from the group; in practice layout.js needs a token/hex fix (Sprint 0) and not-found.js needs almost nothing.
- messages/fr.json, messages/en.json, messages/ar.json, messages/es.json — Section 10 names src/i18n/* (Keep, add new page keys) but never the message catalogues themselves. Chose `extend` because the rebuilt sections 4-5 components and the P1/P5 pages in §3 need new keys while the existing 19 namespaces (common, nav, footer, widget, home, fleet, vehicle, booking, airport, longTerm, chauffeur, about, contact, faqPage, blog, legal, seo, notFound, cookie) all survive the rebrand — copy is not gold-coloured. `rebuild` would needlessly discard 4-language parity work. The `chauffeur` namespace stays: the service was confirmed by Diab Car's own announcement.
- public/images/cars/berline.svg, citadine.svg, coupe.svg, suv.svg, suv-premium.svg, van.svg — Section 10 is silent on public/. Chose `rebuild` rather than `keep` or `delete`: §2.5 requires two environments (light pale ground and near-black rim-lit) and these SVGs are dark-gradient only with hard-coded hexes, so they fail the light-mode and token rules; but §13 still allows silhouettes as a stopgap and src/lib/constants.js, seo.js, og.js and six components resolve /images/cars/<x>.svg as the default image, so deleting them before real photos exist would break the fleet, blog and OG paths. Sprint 1 per §11 ("vehicle card in all states", hero LCP).
- package.json — Section 10 silent. Chose `extend`: §5.4 adds gsap + ScrollTrigger and the View Transitions flag, §2.3 adds @fontsource-variable/archivo, §9.1 adds @opennextjs/cloudflare, and §4 adds react-aria-components for the calendar. Nothing currently listed is removed by the plan (lucide-react, next-themes, motion, next-intl, zod all survive), so `rebuild` is wrong.
- next.config.mjs — Section 10 silent. Chose `extend`: §5.2 requires experimental.viewTransition: true and §9.2 keeps the existing proxy/next-intl wiring, security headers and AVIF/WebP image formats. The res.cloudinary.com remote pattern looks unused and is a candidate for removal inside that same extend, not a reason to rebuild.
- eslint.config.mjs — Section 10 silent. Chose `keep`: it is a thin flat config over eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals with no brand or architecture content. A possible additive change (a rule banning raw hex, to enforce CLAUDE.md rule 2 and the §11 Sprint 0 grep gate) would be an extend, but the plan never asks for it, so `keep` is the defensible reading.
- postcss.config.mjs — Section 10 silent. Chose `keep`: §9.2 keeps Tailwind 4, and section 10's rebuild targets src/styles/globals.css tokens, not the PostCSS pipeline that compiles them.
- jsconfig.json — Section 10 silent. Chose `keep`: the @/* alias is orthogonal to every decision in the plan and §9.2 keeps the same src layout.
- .env.example — Section 10 silent; §9.2 only notes ".env.example exists". Chose `extend` because new services in the plan need new documented keys: SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY and a cron secret for the hold-release job (§6.3, Sprint 2), Cloudflare Turnstile keys (§9.2, Sprint 3) and Web Push VAPID keys (§9.2/§7.4, Sprint 4). Sprint set to 2 because that is the earliest addition.
- .gitignore — Section 10 silent. Chose `keep`: it already tracks .env.example deliberately and already ignores .wrangler/.open-next for the §9.1 Cloudflare path, so no plan item forces a change.
- CLAUDE.md — Section 10 silent. Chose `keep`: §11 says the Claude Code working rules go "in CLAUDE.md when building starts", and the file already carries exactly those rules (JS only, tokens only, light+dark+RTL+reduced-motion, pricing law, RPC writes, no library without a plan line, Lighthouse budget). It is a live rulebook, not code to rebuild.
- docs/MASTER-PLAN.md and docs/PROMPTS.md — Section 10 does not inventory itself. Chose `keep` for both; they are the authority and the build script, and sprint is "—" since no sprint produces them.
- docs/inputs/facts.md, faq.csv, fleet.csv, locations.csv, neighbourhoods.md, logo/README.md, photos/README.md — Section 10 silent. Chose `keep` for all seven: §12 defines them as the intake contract from Diab Car and PROMPTS.md step 4 tells Yahya to fill them, so they are data-collection templates rather than code. They are all still unfilled (TODO/EXAMPLE markers throughout), which is a content risk (§13) rather than a code decision. Sprint numbers assigned by the sprint that first consumes each file.
- src/lib/cn.js — section 10 is silent. Its row 5 word "utilities" refers to the CSS @utility blocks in globals.css, not this JS helper. cn.js is a 7-line dependency-free string joiner with no colour, font or data coupling, so nothing in the rebrand or the availability engine touches it. Chose keep.
- src/lib/constants.js — section 10 is silent. It sits between the data layer (row 3, Extend) and the design rebuild (row 5). Its BOOKING_STATUSES and CATEGORIES enums must grow for §6.2 units/blocks/holds/events, and CAR_IMAGES names the placeholder SVGs that §2.5 replaces with real photography — that is additive, not a rewrite, so chose extend (Sprint 2). Defensible alternative: keep, if the new state machine lands only in Postgres.
- src/lib/actions/admin.js — section 10 names `src/components/admin/*` and `src/app/(admin)/*` but not `src/lib/actions/*`. The same row says "Rebuild IA to section 7; keep server actions pattern, forms, revalidate/IndexNow tools". Since §7.1 replaces the entity set (units, blocks, checklists, customers, notifications) the action module is effectively rewritten while the zod + revalidatePath + redirect pattern survives, so chose rebuild (Sprint 4). Defensible alternative: extend, reading "keep server actions pattern" as keeping this file.
- src/lib/actions/auth.js — section 10 is silent; the nearest row is "Auth (Supabase + demo token), admin base | src/lib/auth/*, src/lib/supabase/* | Keep; add role claim hook". This file is the login/logout half of exactly that auth system and only needs the role claim added, so chose keep (Sprint 4). It is listed here only because its path is under actions/, not auth/.
- src/lib/actions/booking.js — section 10 is silent. Justified from §6.3/§6.4 (availability truth is Postgres, every write through an RPC) and §11 Sprint 3 (4-step funnel with a 10-minute hold timer). The current action validates with zod then calls createBooking directly with no hold, no unit assignment and no conflict handling, so chose rebuild (Sprint 3); the zod schema is reusable, which is why extend is a defensible alternative.
- src/lib/actions/contact.js — section 10 is silent. §3 keeps /contact as an existing P0 page and §10 row 4 keeps the email helper this action leans on. It needs only Turnstile and localized subjects later, so chose keep.
- src/lib/pricing.test.js — section 10 never mentions tests. Its subject, src/lib/pricing.js, is explicitly Keep in row 4, so the suite is kept with it. Chose keep.
- src/lib/format.test.js — section 10 never mentions tests. Its subject, src/lib/format.js, is explicitly Keep in row 4, and this file doubles as the regression test for the scripts/test-register.mjs alias hook that `npm test` depends on. Chose keep.
- src/lib/whatsapp.test.js — section 10 never mentions tests. Its subject, src/lib/whatsapp.js, is Keep in row 4 with "richer WhatsApp templates" added, so the suite is kept and extended in Sprint 3 rather than rebuilt. Chose keep.
- src/components/site/icons.js — §10 never names it. Chose extend: every icon is currentColor and palette-agnostic so nothing must be discarded, but §11 sprint 0's kit (Chip, RedLine, Sheet, Cursor, Skeleton, calendar) will need icons added to this same file. Could defensibly be keep if no icons are added.
- src/components/site/LeadForm.js — §10 never names it, yet the Rebuild row's Files column is the glob `src/components/site/*`. Chose rebuild: it is built entirely on Button/Field (both rebuilt in sprint 0), uses card/gold styling, and §4.13 respecifies form state copy while sprint 3 adds Turnstile. The submitContact server action and WhatsApp fallback are the reusable parts, so extend is the defensible alternative.
- src/components/site/LegalPage.js — §10 never names it. Chose keep: it is a layout shell with no gold utilities, only prose-dc and text-display-2, so a token sweep in sprint 0 is enough. CNDP wording (sprint 6) changes the pages, not this shell.
- src/components/site/MotionProvider.js — §10 never names it. Chose keep: it encodes the locked stack decision in §5.4 (Motion 13, LazyMotion strict, reducedMotion="user"); only the hard-coded ease array moves to the motion tokens.
- src/components/site/ThemeToggle.js — §10's keep row says "Theme … providers", which literally means ThemeProvider.js, but the same row keeps "Language", and LanguageSwitcher is a control rather than a provider, so I read "Theme" as covering the toggle too. Chose keep. Counter-argument for rebuild/extend: it hard-codes #0c0b09 and #f7f3ec for the theme-color meta, which are gold-era palette values and break the no-raw-hex rule, and §11 sprint 0 lists "theme transition" as sprint-0 work.
- src/components/ui/Button.js — §10 never names it (only Reveal.js and Price.js are named under ui/). Chose rebuild because §11 sprint 0 explicitly rebuilds the "base UI kit (Button with sweep/magnetic…)" and the file is saturated with btn-gold plus hard-coded rgba(201,168,92,…) shadows.
- src/components/ui/Field.js — §10 never names it. Chose rebuild: §11 sprint 0 lists Input and Select as kit items, the select chevron embeds a literal #8b8173 hex, and §10's known-bug list puts "time select truncation" in the rebuild.
- src/components/ui/Badge.js — §10 never names it. Chose rebuild: its `gold` tone and accent-soft background disappear with the palette, and §11 sprint 0 lists Chip as the kit equivalent. Extend would be defensible if the component keeps its shape and only loses one tone.
- src/components/ui/Counter.js — §10 never names it. Chose keep: palette-free, reduced-motion aware, and it already renders the final value in SSR HTML. Sprint set to 1 because the rebuilt hero consumes it; §11 sprint 6 lists "count-ups" as polish, so 6 is an equally arguable sprint.
- src/components/ui/Magnetic.js — §10 never names it. Chose keep: no colour, ≤8px travel, hover/pointer-fine and reduced-motion guarded, exactly matching §5.3. Risk: §11 sprint 0 describes "Button with sweep/magnetic", so this wrapper could be absorbed into Button and deleted.
- src/components/ui/SectionHeading.js — §10 never names it. Chose keep: it is a thin composition over Reveal with only typography utilities (eyebrow, text-display-2), which survive the token rebuild even though Archivo replaces Fraunces underneath. Rebuild would only be right if §4 changes the heading anatomy itself.
- GENERAL — src/app/(site)/** : section 10 has no row for public route files at all; it lists only src/components/site/*, src/components/ui/*, src/lib/*, src/styles/*, src/app/sitemap.js, src/app/icon.svg and src/app/(admin)/*. Every decision for a (site) page.js/layout.js is therefore inherited from the components it composes plus the sprint that respecifies the screen (§4/§8.2/§11). Rebuild was applied where §4 gives the screen a full new spec (home 4.2-4.3, results 4.4, vehicle 4.6, funnel 4.7, airport 4.8); extend where only schema/tokens/gold-class debt changes; keep where the file is a thin shell over message/settings data.
- src/app/(site)/[locale]/layout.js — extend. §10 marks providers Keep and tokens/fonts Rebuild, so the provider tree survives but the file itself carries gold-era themeColor hexes (#f7f3ec/#0c0b09) and mounts Header/Footer/WhatsAppFab which are Rebuild. Could equally be argued as keep if the hexes move into tokens.
- src/app/(site)/[locale]/not-found.js — keep. §10 is silent; decision inherited from the 'Keep (tokens change under them)' row for UI kit/providers. Rebuild is arguable because §4.13 rewrites all state copy.
- src/app/(site)/[locale]/[...rest]/page.js — keep. §10 is silent; it is pure routing glue and the routing row is Keep. No sprint owns it.
- src/app/(site)/[locale]/aeroport/page.js — rebuild. §10 is silent; §4.8 gives a full new spec (runway animation, prefilled module, meeting point) and Sprint 5 lists 'Airport page' as scope. Extend would be defensible since answer block and Service JSON-LD already exist.
- src/app/(site)/[locale]/a-propos/page.js — extend. §10 silent; §8.2 requires AboutPage schema instead of the current WebPage, and the 'depuis 2013' claim is unconfirmed (§12.10). Keep would be defensible if the schema swap counts as a token-level change.
- src/app/(site)/[locale]/avec-chauffeur/page.js — keep (pending confirmation). §10 silent; §3 marks the key 'P1/cut — only if Diab Car really offers it (confirm)', so delete is a live possibility. Kept because the cut depends on an unanswered input from Diab Car, and the page currently renders unverified prices (350 MAD transfer, 0.6x half-day) that rule 11 forbids either way.
- src/app/(site)/[locale]/conditions/page.js — keep. §10 silent on legal routes. Content is entirely messages + settings, so the plan's changes (§12.5 cancellation policy) land in messages, not this file.
- src/app/(site)/[locale]/confidentialite/page.js — extend. §10 silent; §9.4 requires the CNDP receipt number and out-of-Morocco transfer wording to be displayed, which needs a visible field this page does not have. Keep is arguable if that wording is added purely in messages/*.json.
- src/app/(site)/[locale]/mentions-legales/page.js — keep. §10 silent; the RC/ICE/capital fixes named in the schema/seed row are data changes, not page changes.
- src/app/(site)/[locale]/contact/page.js — extend, and src/app/(site)/[locale]/faq/page.js — extend. §10 silent; both decisions come from the §8.2 P0 templates (AutoRental + openingHoursSpecification for contact, FAQPage/answer database for FAQ) and Sprint 5.
- src/app/(site)/[locale]/longue-duree/page.js — extend. §10 silent; §3 lists it P1 and Sprint 5 names 'longue durée'. Note the routing.js FR slug (/location-voiture-longue-duree-casablanca) does not match §3 (/location-longue-duree-casablanca) — one of the two must change.
- src/app/(site)/[locale]/og/route.js — rebuild, but this is the weakest call in the set. §10's Logo row names only the renderer src/lib/og.js (Rebuild) and §8.7 says 'OG image route per locale (recolour)' = keep; however §9.3 caching map says 'OG images: static per page (generated at build) instead of a runtime image route → zero CPU per request on Workers' and Sprint 5 says 'static OG per page'. If that is executed literally the correct decision becomes delete.
- src/app/favicon.ico — rebuild. §10 names src/app/icon.svg but not favicon.ico; treated as a member of the Logo group because Sprint 0 explicitly lists 'favicon' among the logo assets.
- src/app/api/health/route.js — keep. §10 is silent on src/app/api/*. Justified by §9.2 (6-hourly keep-alive so the free Supabase project does not pause) and §9.6 (free-limit observability panel). Sprint assignment (6, uptime monitor) is a guess; it is arguably needed from Sprint 2 onward.
